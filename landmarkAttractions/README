Landmark Attractions
by Team Googleplex

Overview:
	landmarkAttractions.py queries fullDatabase.csv for
	searches related to landmarks and uses frontEnd.html
	to display results of the search

How to run:
	1. Making sure fullDatabase.csv is populated 
	-To run this scraper: python3 fullScraper.py
		NOTICE: This scraper takes a long time, if the scraper keeps failing before fullDatabase.csv is fully populated: set STARTNEW = False on line 10 in fullScraper.py and run fullScraper.py again. This will continue scraping from where you last left off. Keep running fullScraper.py until the database is poulated

	2. Running the server
	(Whoosh and Flask must be installed)
	-To run this program: FLASK_APP=landmarkAttractions.py flask run

	3. Accessing the website
	NOTICE: I tested the website in firefox, you may have to stretch the window to
	fit all of the components into the screen
	-While the server is running go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
